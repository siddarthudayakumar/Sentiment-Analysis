# Sentiment-Analysis
My Twitter Sentiment Analysis project from my Machine Learning course. It uses classifiers from NLTK.

* Training Set CSV files contain the training data consisting of tweets that are labelled positive or negative.
* twitter_streaming.py contains my Twitter App API keys and the functions that allow us to stream tweets about a particular search term.
* preprocessor.py allows for preprocessing the tweets by removing URLS and emoticons.
* NLTKclassifier.py consists of the Naive Bayes Classifier
* MEnClassifier.py consists of the Maximum Entropy Classifier.
